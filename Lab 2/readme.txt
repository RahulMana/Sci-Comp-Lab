1. Use the table driver to print tables out to the prompt. 
2. Use ODE_tests to probe values and get plots for the different schemes. 
3. The table driver can be expected to plot the data corresponding to the Runge function.
 This is a sanity check. Do not assume that the table_driver is designed for plotting. It is not.
